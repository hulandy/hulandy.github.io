To my dear son

Hi. First of all, this is not a death note to say goodbye, just to be clear. The reason that I'd like to share with you this is because that these minds appeared several times, and I think I have to do it eventually.

The others' father once been the age like me right now, usually have had a bunch of money, but  negative to me. What I got right now is my thoughts and the willingness to make money in my rest of the life, it's not necessarily to be rich but stable. To have the ability to protect my family.

And now I just want to admit that, I was an idiot. The reason why I was it, hopefully not is an idiot still. The reasons : 1. DNA 2. I hadn't learned and thought for a long time, that caused my brain became dumb. 3.  Alcohol and few smoking . Those two things are bad, you don't even need to try them. 4. Unless one exception: I was raised by my grandmother, Once upon a time, I missed her, and I told God I would like to use my own life to extend my grandma's life. I know that may sound ridiculous. But I believe God is here, it's just because we can't understand his goals. That beyond our understanding. Somehow I chose to believe.
To go to America is my dream, because that I would likely to have more chances to give us a relatively stable life. But, not too far ago, I found that I never have the actual dream to be in The US, instead I was always with my grandma.
I am so regret that I was an idiot. 
It's important to you to avoid my path.
Always be strong, never get down by any chance. Try your best to love the ones you love. To acquire the abilities to do it.

Let's do it together.
